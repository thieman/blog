**[Get it now on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-selfies/ldnpkdnkgkogfnahcnldaedcoadjbkbl)**

**[Now available for Firefox, too!](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/github-selfies/)**

[GitHub Selfies](https://github.com/thieman/github-selfies) lets you add webcam [selfies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdemFfbS5H0) to pull requests and pull request comments on GitHub. That's it. Really. So now you can [be encouraging](https://i.imgur.com/nFKCOXy.png). Or [happy!](https://i.imgur.com/IannNci.png) Or show off your [Minecraft ocelot](https://i.imgur.com/1A1UzDs.png). Or your [favorite Pok√©mon](https://i.imgur.com/Lj6TXP3.png).

**Update**: Now you can put selfies in issues, too! The new version is up on the Chrome store as v1.1.

I'm also anticipating that it will be the most reviled bit of code I ever write. But, hey, it was fun, so why not? GitHub had a pretty good run before it was destroyed by a plague of selfies.

Thanks to [beerops](https://twitter.com/beerops) for beta testing and to the legions of idiotic editorial writers complaining about us narcissistic millennials for inspiring the project.
